CoViD19 prevalence in Italy: comparison of ISTAT campaign vs model

I wrote a paper on CoViD19 with my friends Fabio Verachi and Luciano Lanzi in April-May 2020. In august 2020 ISTAT published results of a serological campaign so I wrote a
jupyter notebook to compare model predictions with observet data. ISTAT prevalence figure is 2.5% (2.3-2.6 at 95%), while our model implies 2.8%, so error is 0.3%.
